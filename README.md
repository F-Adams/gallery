# Simplistic Thumbnail Gallery
A very simplistic and feature lacking image thumbnail gallery app utilizing PHP, CSS, JavaScript and HTML.

This project is essentially a practice coding project for me, used as a vehicle for learning and improving my own web development skills.

This is not an efficient script! It loads each full size image and simply displays it as a scaled thumbnail.
I am considering writing A utility script that will generate actual scaled thumbnail images and then display those in the gallery instead.
